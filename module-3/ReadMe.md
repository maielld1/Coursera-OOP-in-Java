#Introduction

Data visualization is a powerful technique for spotting trends. In this programming assignment, you will write a program that helps visualize earthquake data. Earthquakes are happening daily around the world. Geological analysis suggests which locations will be prone to higher seismic activity. You will plot recent earthquakes on a map to highlight potential disaster zones.

As you work on this project, keep in mind that most of your code will work equally well with any other geotagged data: from disease outbreaks to airplane crashes to discoveries of resource-rich mines, and beyond!

Your map will read earthquake data from a live RSS feed (an online source of frequently updated data, see Wikipedia entry for details): http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/2.5_week.atom. You will then plot markers in the locations where earthquakes of magnitude 2.5 or higher have occurred in the last week. Then, you will customize your map and markers.
